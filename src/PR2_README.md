3d_navigation
=============

Global and local path planner plugins for ROS move_base which move the robot in 2D (x,y,angle) but avoid collisions using full 3D data (robot meshes and environment octomap).

See http://www.ros.org/wiki/3d_navigation for details.

Status

This package is currently under development.  Most recently it ran with ROS Diamondback on a PR2.
